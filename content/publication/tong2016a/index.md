abstract: The performance of mobile computing would be significantly improved by leveraging cloud computing and migrating mobile workloads for remote execution at the cloud. In this paper, to efficiently handle the peak load and satisfy the requirements of remote program execution, we propose to deploy cloud servers at the network edge and design the edge cloud as a tree hierarchy of geo-distributed servers, so as to efficiently utilize the cloud resources to serve the peak loads from mobile users. The hierarchical architecture of edge cloud enables aggregation of the peak loads across different tiers of cloud servers to maximize the amount of mobile workloads being served. To ensure efficient utilization of cloud resources, we further propose a workload placement algorithm that decides which edge cloud servers mobile programs are placed on and how much computational capacity is provisioned to execute each program. The performance of our proposed hierarchical edge cloud architecture on serving mobile workloads is evaluated by formal analysis, small-scale system experimentation, and largescale trace-based simulations.
