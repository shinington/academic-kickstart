Machine learning (ML) has been widely used in security applications such as anomaly and malware
detection. Despite the striking success of ML in security applications, security
issues emerge from the full pipeline of ML-based detection systems. First, ML models are often
susceptible to evasion attacks, in which an adversary makes changes to the input (such as
malware) to avoid being detected. Second, using detection systems in practice is in dealing with an
overwhelming number of alerts that are triggered by normal behavior (the so-called false positives),
obscuring alerts resulting from actual malicious activities. Third, adversaries can target a
broad array of ML-based detection systems to maximize impact, which is often ignored by individual
ML system designers. My research addresses these challenges by designing robust features, robust
ML models, and robust alert prioritization. Through continuous research in this field, I envision
robust end-to-end and multi-scale ML-based detection systems.
